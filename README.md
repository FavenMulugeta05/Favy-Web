# Favy Web

**Favy Web** is the personal portfolio site of Faven Mulugeta- an artist, animator, and creative technologist. 

https://favenmulugeta.com

Every element on this site has been hand-drawn by the artist herself, merging illustration with interactivity to create a web experience aimed to mirror the warmth of her work. Rather than leaning into sterile, 
cookie-cutter templates, *Favy Web* offers a playful, nostalgic escape from the minimalism of modern web design- returning to the handcrafted basics of a pencil and sketchbook.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site includes:
- Interactive carousels
- A flipbook made with `turn.js`
- Custom forms and animated UI

The result is a personal webspace that prioritizes storytelling and user delight.

Enjoy!
